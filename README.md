# String validation 

Write a pragram that reads, a string S, check S if the string S satisfies all the below conditions: 
    > S should contain only letters and underscores(_)
    > All letter in S should be  uppercase (A-Z)
    
    Note: S can contain multiple words and all the words in S are separated by underscore (MANGO_TREE)
    
    input = "MANGO_TREE" 
    > The input will be a single line containing a string
    
    output = True 2 
    > print True and number of words separated by a space if all the given conditions are satisfied
    > Print False if any condition is not met
